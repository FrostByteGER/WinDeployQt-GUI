# WinDeployQt-GUI

## Simple GUI for WinDeployQt 
Annoyed by using the commandline all the time? Prefer fancy user-interfaces over commandlines? Then this tool is just perfect for you! Simply configure everything and click Deploy. Thats it. Nothing more, nothing less. Need more control? Fine, just switch to manual edit mode and modify the generated cmd command!


## Compilation
Prequisites:
* Visual Studio 2017
* Qt 5.10 or above(It should work with any 5.x version, but I tested it only with 5.10!)
* Windows 10 64-Bit

### Trivia
This project has been made with C++17 features.
